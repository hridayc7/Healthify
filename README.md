# Healthify

* Conceptualized and coded in-depth macronutrient tracker that tracks not only calorie, carbohydrate and fat intake, but also added sugars, saturated fats, trans/saturated fats, and sodium intake based on user lifestyle (sedentary/moderate/active)
* Users can track these macronutrients by simply taking a photo of their food; app will run the image through an image classifier that recognizes the food and automatically adds the food’s macronutrient information to the users’ daily log
* Code elements used in the App include: CoreML 3 and vision, UIpicker views, UINavigation controllers, unwind segues
